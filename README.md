This project creates a Docker image that automates setting up a Half-Life dedicated server, version 1.0.1.6, using the WON2 protocol. This docker image also includes several popular Counter-Strike beta mods that are still played by the community, which are Counter-Strike Beta 3.1, Beta 4.0, Beta 5.2, and Beta 6.1.

**Please note this project is done independently of CS-Legacy or any other known retro-CS communities.**

# Requirements
- docker
- docker-compose

### Why this docker ?

There are a few communities around the World that still play the betas of Counter-Strike online. However, I have noticed that community-wise, noone took time to create an easy way to create servers in a matter of seconds. As a result, creating a server is messy and unreliable, which is not really a good way to bring new players. 

This project makes sure everyone can host these versions of Counter-Strike in a very simple and configurable way.

### Features
* Creates a barebones HLDS Environment using Debian (i386), using vanilla files and security patches only when applicable.
* Server settings can be configured without the requirement of rebuilding the docker image (with the exception of Half-Life 1)
* Everything is 100% vanilla, with the only exception of the custom masterservers that the community are using.

### Included mods
- Counter-Strike beta 6.1
- Counter-Strike beta 5.2
- Counter-Strike beta 4.0
- Counter-Strike beta 3.1

### Installation/Usage

Simply edit the `docker-compose.yml` to add or modify anything you require.

If you need to change the port of your server, change all occurences of `27015` (= in `ports` and in the `command` sections) to the desired port of your choice.

Change also the `user` token so that it is checking with the user and group running the container, to avoid upload issues or potential permission problems.

**Example of Docker-Compose file**
```yml
version: "3.5"

services:
  hlds:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    user: "1000:1000" # <- Change this to your UID:GID
    volumes:
      - ./config/cstrk52:/server/hlds_l/cstrk52 
      - ./config/cstrk61:/server/hlds_l/cstrk61
      - ./config/cstrk40:/server/hlds_l/cstrk40 
      - ./config/cstrk31:/server/hlds_l/cstrk31
    ports:
      - 27015:27015
      - 27015:27015/udp
    command:
      - -port 27015 -game cstrk61 +map de_dust +maxplayers 16
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:1
```

Once done, just execute `docker compose up` to make sure everything works as intended, and you should be good to go.

If you need to rebuild the image (to add a few additional things for instance), just type `docker compose build` and you should be good to go.

### Customisation
Simply go to the `config` folder, and modify the required folders you wish.

- `config/cstrk61` is for Counter-Strike Beta 6.1.
- `config/cstrk52` is for Counter-Strike Beta 5.2.
- `config/cstrk40` is for Counter-Strike Beta 4.0.
- `config/cstrk31` is for Counter-Strike Beta 3.1.
- `config/valve` is for Half-Life. **However, since no playerbase really exists for Half-Life WON2 (people play it on STEAM instead), this only includes the WON2 masterservers.** 

# FAQ

### Do I have to include +sv_lan 1?
Nope! It's already included inside `hlds_start` (which is basically a renamed `hlds_run` script), so you don't have to!

### Will this work natively with that Half-Life 1.0.1.6 package I found online?
Of course! The server will be spread to both the WON2 and the Order of Phalanx masterservers!

### Why is there no presence of CS Beta 1.x, 2.x?
Simply because these versions do not have Linux builds available! You can verify them all on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ch0wW/counterstrike-betas) if you need more information.
